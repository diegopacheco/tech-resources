# Diego Pacheco's Way of Working

## This is not for you IF

1. You have no comitmment
2. You will not invest the time to read, do POCs, homeworks
3. You do not have maturity to recive direct feedback in public
4. You dont have english or is not willing to learn in 3 months
5. You don't want to change, you dont belive in your coaches/mentors
6. Want complain for sake of complaing, not solution oriented

## Do not expect to be easy

1. I promisse ZERO COMFORT ZONE.
2. You will need to lern a lot and deliver a lot
3. High performance teams are not for everyone, they have high pressure.
4. You will need to be very proactive, take ownership and be autonomous, organized, disciplined on top of things.
5. Feedback will be constant and direct, you will need to be mature to handle it.
6. You will need to be very good on comunication, fast response on slack, calls, emails.
7. We expect the best solutions, the best code, the best design, best tests, best automation, nothing but the best.

### Culture

High performant team. Lot's of amazing people, high demanding, high expectations, high standards.
Manifested as:

* Callout all the time, no matter how many people on the call/room
* Open, Honest and constant feedback
* Expectation on constant deliver: PRs Weekly
* Expectation on constant learning: daily/weekly reading, POCs and Homeworks
* Demand of great comunication on slack, instant response
* High level of autonomy and Maturity
* Extreme ownership

At the same time you can count on:

* A lot of learning
* A lot of support/help
* NO delay to get feedback and course correction
* As long as you are delivering and listening to feedback, we will have patience

### Important Reasurance

1. High performance sport teams like NBA, European Football leagues, they have families and lives.
2. You will learn how to operate in a another level.
3. IF the best team motivate you, want chanlenges, you will grow.
4. Feel empowered to give push backs.
5. We care!

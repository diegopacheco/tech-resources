## 0. How to do a good POC

Proof of Concept (POC) is a important tool, it's like a lab where you should be doing experiments.
POC allow you to learn something about a programing language, approach, school of tought, library or even to validate some crazy idea/hack.
POC can be shallow but is important to have Deep POCs. Doing POCs must be a mindset, something you do everyday.

## 1. How to go Deep in a POC?
* Debug the code (write down classes names, make diagrams) do it multiple times
* Write down code that test, simulate or exaserbate the problem or target of your poc
* Do Research, see what other people do, are there any patterns? or idiomatic ways of doing this? 
* Read the documentation, read book, avoid tutotials, read the source code
* Do experiments, test the API in several different conditions and scenarios of sucess and error see what happens
* Reading the source code of a framework or library is a must, is how you can understand how it works and how to use it

## 2. What NOT todo in POC?
* Be shallow all the time
* Just call methods
* Do not challenge yourself, if you know is too easy is not a good POC

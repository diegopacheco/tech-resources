## 0. How to do a good POC

Proof of Concept (POC) is a important tool, it's like a lab where you should be doing experiments.
POC allow you to learn something about a programing language, approach, school of tought, library or even to validate some crazy idea/hack.
POC can be shallow but is important to have Deep POCs. Doing POCs must be a mindset, something you do everyday.

## 1. How to go Deep in a POC?
* Debug the code (write down classes names, make diagrams) do it multiple times
* Write down code that test, simulate or exaserbate the problem or target of your poc
* Do Research, see what other people do, are there any patterns? or idiomatic ways of doing this?
* Read the documentation, read book, avoid tutotials, read the source code
* Do experiments, test the API in several different conditions and scenarios of sucess and error see what happens
* Reading the source code of a framework or library is a must, is how you can understand how it works and how to use it

## 2. What NOT todo in POC?
* Be shallow all the time
* Just call methods
* Do not challenge yourself, if you know is too easy is not a good POC

## 4. Keep in mind
 * The more you pratice, the better you get.
 * POCs comparing libraries, approaches, languages, patterns help a lot to learn and master tecnhiques.
 * Make sure it gets harder, no matter if you need to do 10-100x to understand. Repetition is key.
 * You are only fooling yourself if you just go shallow all the time.
 * Doing Shallow pocs is not neccesary bad or wrong, but you should be doing Deep POCs as well.
 * Challenge yourself, do not be afraid to fail, is part of the learning process.
 * Consider doing crazy things like: a parser, a compiler, a framework, a library, maybe even a new language.
 * Remember learning with code is a long term game and a mindset, so keep doing it everyday.

## 5. To improve
 * Share the code with others ask feedback
 * look for different and better ways to do the same thing
 * Be curious, ask questions, do not be afraid to ask for help
 * Go read the source code of big projects, is a great way to learn like: Java, Spring, Netty, Linux, React, Nodejs, etc.
 * Document your POC, write text exmplaning what you did a why and why is impotant.
 * Good POCs take hours, days and weeks and thats fine, the more time you invest the better you get.
 * Make doing POCs a habit, do it everyday, is like going to the gym, you need to do it everyday to get better.

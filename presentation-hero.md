# Presentation Hero

Read this multiple times and follow strickly and will be awesome at presenting.

## Before you start

Preparation is everythinng. When should I start preparing? 30 days before your presentation day. Why you need start 30 days ahead?
* Because you will need time to research
* Because you will get feedback and will have homework
* Because even if your deck is amazing, you need do multiple dry runs before presenting.

How many dry runs is enought?
* There is not limit, more preparation is always better.
* You must feel confident and be able to deliver on time
* You should dry run so many times that you can present without slides (presentation zen idea).
* Usually 3 to 5 dry runs is enough

## How to deliver a great presentation

A great presentation is just an output of a well-prepared research, poc or piece of work.
There is no way you will do an amazing presentation if you the content is not good.
A presentation is just an excuse, a reason or a motivation if you will do learn someeting deep and deliver an awesome experience.
When you are presenting, you are delivering a story, think about order of things.

## 0. What you should never (ever) do

 * Present content you don't understand
 * You DONT know DEEPLY all the things you are presenting, all the strings, all the algos, all the techniques, all technologies, every single thing you don't master it.
 * Talk about things you did not run a poc or some experiment or have experience with in production
 * Have a lot of text and just read all time
 * Have a white background with or poor color scheme. 
 * Splash code in text, dont show code without syntax highlight
 * Do no sufer in silence, ask for help
 * Dont do the presentation for compliance, do your best, use as a tool for continnuous learning and improvement

## 1. What you should always do

 * Research
    * Do POCs
    * Debug
    * Google it
    * Read about it
  * Give Context: What it is? How it works? Showing arch diagrams always good.  
  * Always have trade-offs (PROS and CONS)  
  * Comparisons with similar solutins and options always good i.e talking about Kafka, compare with RabbitMQ, Kinesis, ActiveMQ, etc.
  * CODE
  * Live-demo (which can be recorded)

## 2. How to prepare

  * Record you presenting to your self like a unit test (do that 3 to 5 times) this is also called Dry Run
  * Show to someone with more experience - get feedback
  * The more you present, the better you get, pratice is the key to success
  * Dry Runs: Do many dry runs as necessary, record a video so you see youself presenting and what is working or not, get feedback from other people. 

## 3. How to create a good presentation structure

  1. What: Explain what it thing you are presenting.
  2. How: Explain how it works and how is the architecture under the hood.
  3. Trade-offs: Explain the trade-offs, pros and cons.
  4. Code/DEMO: Show code, if possible, live demo is always good.
  5. Comparisons: Show comparisons with similar solutions.


## 4. How to deliver

  * Be clam
  * Dont rush
  * Mind the time (have a clock in front of you) or in yoir phone
  * Ask for feedback after the presentation

## 5. How to improve

  * Read the book `Presentation Zen` by Garr Reynolds
  * Try to add some humor, data, facts or intersting trivia is always fun
  * Watch other people presenting
  * Use google for research, read books, read papers, debug the code, do multiple pocs.
  * Book time in your agenda to prepare the presentation (review and dry-run too)

## 6. When you learn to how to present well...

  * You will comunicate better
  * You will sell better
  * You will be more confident

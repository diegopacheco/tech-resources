## Tech Study

I have this repository since 2017. I always had this collections of resources to give "tips" and "directions" to people I was mentoring/coaching. This book it's a `Recipies` book. It's has a colection of resources to help people to get better. It's a cookbook of self-improvement for tech professionals.

#### How to use this gist?

This gist contains lists of resources about JS, Mobile, Architecture/DevOps and Cloud Native. Each gist has a list <BR> 
of technologies that you can do POC and CODE practice, also with a list of useful books and links. <BR> 

#### Method

* Create a github repository called sandbox-<track> where track is: js,ArchDevOps,CN or Mobile. 
* Code every week some POC or feature impl of each technology on the lsit.
* You should be reading one book at the time. You need make notes from your readings.
* Reading 10 pages per week is progress, you should push your self to read some pages everyweek.
* After reading and coding for some time about a specific subject lets say Automation/Ansible consider doing a LT.
* You need to understand what you are coding, ask for code review. 
* You need make sure you got concepts right, validate with more experienced engineers. 
* Progress is best tracked in Weekly Coaching Sessions. 
* Balance is always welcome. You might use the Breath/Deepth method where 90% time invested on main topic and 10% on random.
* No matter your specific field like JS or CN you should read all this book: [Agile Dev Resources](./agile-dev-resources.md)

### JS

[JavaScript Frontend Resources](./js-frontend-resources.md)

### Mobile

[Mobile Resources](./mobile-resources.md)

### Cloud Native

[Cloud Native Resources](./cloud-native-resources.md)

### Software Architecture | DevOps Engineering

[Architecture DevOps Resources](./arch-devops-resources.md)

### GCP

[GCP Resources](./GCP-resources.md)

#### POC Ideas

* Get all language/framework/lib features and do some simple code.
* Most of technical books have sample codes and excercis you can use for POC.
* Look for a problem in your project or company or something you could improve.
* [99 Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/)
* [Dojo Puzzle](http://dojopuzzles.com/)
* Create a simple version(smaller scale) of:
* - Facebook
* - Twitter
* - Netflix
* - Flickr
* - Slack
* - GitHub

Cheers, <BR>

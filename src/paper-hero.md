# Paper Hero

Papers are important, because most of breakthroughs in technology are first
described in research papers. There is a lot of value in reading papers to
stay up to date with the latest advancements, and to get inspiration for new
ideas.

## How to Read a paper

1. **Skim the paper**: Start by reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion to get a high-level understanding of the paper's goals and contributions.
2. **Identify key sections**: Look for sections that are most relevant to your interests or research. Focus on these sections first.
3. **Take notes**: As you read, take notes on important concepts, methods, and results. Summarize key points in your own words to reinforce understanding.
4. **Understand the methodology**: Pay close attention to the methods used in the paper. Try to understand the experiments.

Pretty much all PDF readers, even you browser(let's say chrome) has a highlighting tool. Use it to highlight important parts of the paper. You should use this.

## Presenting Papers

Presenting papers is a great challenge because papers can be as long as big books and usualy yhem are at least 7-15 pages long, but very often much bigger. It's not unusual to see papers that are 100+ pages long. So you can't just read the whole paper. 

Presenting a paper(whichout slides) forces you to:

1. **Understand**: Make sure you understand the paper well enough to explain it to others.
2. **Select**: Identify the most important points and contributions of the paper.
3. **Practice**: Practice your communication skills by explaining complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. (Dry runs, Dry runs, Dry runs...)

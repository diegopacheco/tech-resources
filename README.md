## Disclaimer

I have had this repository since `2017`. There are no proprietary materials from past or future employers. I have been doing coaching/mentorship with tech professionals for decades. Here you will find links to coding problems, books, tech, what to learn, and my take on several things, alongside links to my books and my blogs.
